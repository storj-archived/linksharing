# Link Sharing Service

## Building

```
$ go install storj.io/linksharing
```

## Configuring

### Development

Default development configuration has the link sharing service hosted on
`localhost:8080` serving plain HTTP.

```
$ linksharing setup --defaults dev
```

### Production

To configure the link sharing service for production, run the `setup` command
using the `release` defaults. An required argument is the location of the geo-location database.
You must also provide the public URL for the sharing service, which is used to construct URLs returned to
clients. Since there is currently no server affinity for requests, the URL
can point to a pool of servers:

```
$ linksharing setup --defaults release --geo-location-db <PATH TO FILE> --public-url <PUBLIC URL> 
```

**NOTE**: Please follow this link for instructions how to install/download the geo-location database:

Default release configuration has the link sharing service hosted on `:8443`
serving HTTPS using a server certificate (`server.crt.pem`) and
key (`server.key.pem`) residing in the working directory where the linksharing
service is run.

You can modify the configuration file or use the `--cert-file` and `--key-file`
flags to configure an alternate location for the server keypair.

In order to run the link sharing service in release mode serving HTTP, you must
clear the certificate and key file configurables:

```
$ linksharing setup --defaults release --public-url <PUBLIC URL> --cert-file="" --key-file="" --address=":8080"
```

**WARNING** HTTP is only recommended if you are doing TLS termination on the
same machine running the link sharing service as the link sharing service
serves unencrypted user data.

## Running

After configuration is complete, running the link sharing is as simple as:

```
$ linksharing run
```
